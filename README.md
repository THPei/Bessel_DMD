# Bessel_DMD
Software for the Paper in Software Impacts

  We provide numerical software based on the MATLAB programming language to study the Bessel-like beams generated by special instruments such as DMD to compare with other methods. The calculations are based on the scalar Fresnel-Kirchhoff integration, which is within the scope of Fourier Optics. This analysis is particularly important because the addition of higher-order Bessel terms may produce additional unexpected experimental results in some applications. We emphasize the seldom-mentioned imaging characteristic on the lens, where the central point is shifted, and provide important theoretical derivation to understand the expression of the Bessel-like function obtained in this way.
